## PORTFOLIO

Welcome to my personal portfolio website—a digital canvas showcasing my journey in web development, crafted during my internship at Prodigy Infotech. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this responsive platform highlights seven interactive projects—from an AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe game to a smart banking system—each reflecting my commitment to clean code, user-centered design, and functional creativity. Explore the blend of technical precision and modern aesthetics that defines my approach to building digital experiences. Whether you're a fellow developer, recruiter, or tech enthusiast, I hope this portfolio offers insight into my skills and passion for crafting impactful web solutions.
